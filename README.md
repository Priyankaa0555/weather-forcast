Weather Forecasting Web Application
This project is a modern, responsive Weather Forecasting Web Application that allows users to check real-time weather conditions for any city worldwide. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and powered by the OpenWeatherMap API, this project was developed as part of my internship at CodTech Solutions Pvt. Ltd.. It aims to demonstrate practical API integration, frontend interactivity, and a clean user experience through a visually polished UI.

🔍 Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to build a weather forecasting tool where users can:

Input a city name.

Fetch current weather data via an API.

View live temperature, weather conditions, wind speed, and date-time.

Get a smooth and engaging user interface experience using animations and styling.

💻 Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (jQuery)

External APIs: OpenWeatherMap API

Libraries Used:

Moment.js – for formatted date & time

Animate.css – for entrance animations

Font Awesome – for icons

Google Fonts – for modern typography

📌 Features
🔎 City Search: Users can enter any city and retrieve live weather data.

🌡️ Temperature Display: Shows real-time temperature in °C with precise rounding.

🌬️ Wind Speed: Displays wind speed in m/s.

🌤️ Weather Description: Provides a short textual description of the current conditions.

📅 Current Date & Time: Live timestamp using Moment.js.

🧪 Input Validation: Alerts users if a city is not found.

🎨 Modern UI: Responsive and card-based layout with animation and hover effects.

📲 Mobile Friendly: Works across screen sizes with flexible styling.

🧠 How It Works
The user types a city name into the input field and clicks the "Get Weather" button.

An asynchronous request is made to the OpenWeatherMap API using fetch().

The data is parsed and displayed on the screen using jQuery.

Elements such as temperature, description, wind speed, and time are dynamically updated.

The layout is visually enhanced with CSS transitions and entry animations.

🎨 UI/UX Highlights
The interface was designed with a focus on simplicity, readability, and visual appeal. The weather-card is styled with a semi-transparent background, soft shadows, and hover transitions for interactivity. Input elements are styled for better user engagement, while color gradients in the background create a pleasant aesthetic.

⚠️ API Key Notice
The OpenWeatherMap API key used is public in the current version for demo purposes. For production, always keep your API keys secure. You can replace the API key in script.js with your own for uninterrupted use.

📈 Future Enhancements
5-day forecast with hourly breakdown

Weather icons integration (currently present but commented)

City auto-complete suggestions

Dark/light mode toggle

🏁 Conclusion
This Weather App is a demonstration of how APIs, modern frontend technologies, and good UI practices can come together to build a functional and elegant weather dashboard. It emphasizes clean design, real-time data handling, and responsiveness.
